## Game states

Implemented (3):

| State | Class | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GalaxyMap` | `GalaxyMapState` | Top-level galaxy overview, star selection |
| `SystemMap` | `SystemMapState` | 2D orbital map of selected star system |
| `SystemSpace` | `SystemSpaceState` | In-system 3D flight, including atmospheric flight |

**Architectural note — FlightMode, not separate states:**
Atmospheric flight is a `FlightMode` enum within `SystemSpaceState`, not a separate
`GameState`. The sim thread and all ship state run continuously through the transition.
`FlightMode` controls which forces the sim applies and which render passes are active.

```csharp
public enum FlightMode
{
    Docked,
    SystemNewtonian,          // Gear-ceiling force-based Newtonian
    SystemSlipstream,         // Harmonic warp-speed flight
    AtmosphericNewtonian,     // Force-based atmospheric (gravity, drag, lift)
    AtmosphericSlipstream,    // High-speed atmospheric mode
}
```

Planned future GameStates (not yet designed or implemented):

```csharp
enum GameState
{
    GalaxyMap, SystemMap,
    HyperspaceEntry, Hyperspace, HyperspaceExit,
    SystemSpace,   // all FlightMode variants run within this state
    Surface,       // on foot — future
    Docked
}
```

`PlanetApproach` and `Atmosphere` have been removed as separate GameStates.

Navigation flow (current): Galaxy map → (double-click star) → System map → (double-click body) → System flight, spawning near the selected body.

## What is in progress

### Power system — refinement phase

Core working: reactor, bus, shield startup sequence, instruments. Needs:
- More ship components wired in (engine power draw, gyro, artificial gravity)
- FlyabilityMonitor checks
- Heat system implementation
- Coolant loop

---

## What is next (priority order)

1. **Flight model tuning** — runtime investigation needed for remaining Brief E1 items:
   - Station approach: proximity scale + 20 km dropout + 400 m/s exit cap ✓
   - Clunk: Newtonian-only, 570 ms (10-node), camera-space roll, X-STOP HUD ✓
   - DriveInstrumentPanel (gear/speed instrument) ✓
   - PRES row in atmo HUD ✓
   - **Fix 3 resolved**: `Star.GetPhysicals` was multiplying stellar radius by `Units.SolarRadius` twice (`StarPhysics.StellarRadius` already returns metres). Temperatures now plausible (~200–600 K). Also fixed `altFraction` clamp in `ComputeTemperature` to `[0,1]` (was unbounded above 1 when ship is underground).
   - **Fix 6 resolved**: `UpdateEnvironment` was accepting bodies with negative `alt` as `_nearAtmBody` (ship inside planet in ecliptic space always passes `alt < ceiling`). Added `alt >= 0` guard. Also clamped `_nearBodyAltitude` to `Math.Max(0, alt)` to prevent negative values poisoning `ComputeProximityScale` (which would give negative effective slipstream speed).
   - **Fix 7 pending**: Verify atmo slipstream mode label and visual speed change in-game.
   - **Atmospheric entry velocity fix**: Slipstream→atmosphere direct transition now zeroes planet-relative velocity (was carrying forward harmonic as real speed → 17 km/s). Planet dropout uses body's actual `ComputeVelocity()` not blended `GetRefVelocity()`. Drag coefficients increased 5× (Sidewinder: front 0.75, lateral 2.0; Cobra: front 1.10, lateral 2.75).
2. **Sky rendering** — atmosphere colour gradient + haze at low altitude; pass through Atmosphere.fx in SystemSpaceState
3. **Station text/markings pass** — station name on hull, bay numbers
4. **Power system refinement** — heat, coolant, more components

---

## Key conventions

- **Rate properties** (`MaxPower`, `PowerConsumption`, reactor output): always **watts (W)**
- **Storage properties** (`MaxJ`, capacitors): always **joules (J)**
- **Thermal mass** (`HeatCapacity`): always **J/K** (joules per kelvin)
- Each tick: `energy (J) = power (W) × dt`
- No display scaling in simulation; `InstrumentMeter.ScaleFactor` handles unit conversion for gauges
- No MW or MJ in code — raw SI throughout
- Topic convention on DataBus: `ComponentName.ValueName`; multiple instances: `ComponentName_N.ValueName`
- `ShipRecord` must not appear outside `ShipBuilder`, `ShipExtensions`, and `ShipPersistenceService`
- `ShipBuilder` is the sole construction path for `Ship`

## Project structure

```
Inferior.Core        — DVec3, Units, DataBus, CommandBus, GameClock, Noise, PlayerInput, Topics
Inferior.Galaxy      — star/system generation, OrbitalBody, StarPhysics
Inferior.Gameplay    — Simulation, Physics/, SensorData/, Sensors/, TargetingSystem
Inferior.Persistence — ShipRecord, repositories, log (pure IO, no live objects)
Inferior.Rendering   — Camera3D, MeshFactory
Inferior.UI          — UIManager, UIRenderer, Theme, all controls
Inferior.Game        — entry point, game states, SpaceSimulation, ShipBuilder, factories,
                       StationGenerator, StationDecorator, StationModuleRegistry
```

Dependency: `Core ← Galaxy ← Gameplay ← Persistence` and `Core ← UI`, all converging in `Game`.

## Station generation — architecture summary

See `inferior-design-stations-claude.md` for full reference. Key facts:

- **Generation is deterministic** — same seed always produces same station
- **Pre-baked lighting** — directional light and AO applied at generation time to vertex colours; renderer draws static meshes
- **Screen-space glow** — `StationLightInfo` list on `StationModel`; `DrawStationGlows` uses `BlendState.Additive` SpriteBatch pass after 3D scene
- **AnimTag stubs** — warning strobes tagged for future animation; renderer does not yet use them
- **Decoration order matters** — occupancy tracking ensures no overlaps; passes run in fixed order; AO and lighting always last
